# obscurx-browser
A browser UI that is including 5 - 6 different search engines

- First of all, I do OWN the UI. I wanted to make something like Kando running on a web browser.

It has different features.

>• Right-click menu
>>• Responsive UI
>>>• Good looking design

## New patch updates!

1. Changed Right-click menu's icon filter system. Now Icons are looking bigger and more clear.
2. Added 2 more new themes. Nord (taken from Fafnir's UI) and added Blood Glass
3. Fafnir's search style added to ObscurX (can switch between them in settings menu)
4. Added Ghost Mode
